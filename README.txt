This project demonstrates how to build a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict employee salaries based on several independent variables such as years of experience, education level, job role, and other relevant features.

The goal is to show how machine learning can be used to model real-world salary data and assist in data-driven decision-making for HR analytics, workforce planning, or compensation benchmarking.
